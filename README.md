# Mingo Crack - PRO Activator

## Why do I prefer Mingo over MongoDB Compass?
As a Full Stack developer, I often work with MongoDB Compass. But, I find it to be a bit of a hassle to work with. Since then, I started looking out for some other MongoDB GUI Client which is has a little more better feel and a bit more advanced features. 🤷‍♂️

Found myself [Mingo](https://mingo.io)! A really good MongoDB GUI Client with all the features that I was looking for and also with a great UI. ⭐
